      <h2>PEPPER</h2>
      <p class="date">Nov 7th, 2017</p>
      <p>Piper nigrum (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning, known as a peppercorn. When fresh and fully mature, it is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter and dark red, and contains a single seed, like all drupes. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), and white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).</p>

      <p>Black pepper is native to present day Kerala in Southwestern India[2][3] and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions. Vietnam is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's P. nigrum crop as of 2013.</p>

      <p>Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity both for its flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical piperine, not to be confused with the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning and is often paired with salt.

      <h2>Toni Braxton</h2>
      <p class="date">Nov 7th, 2017</p>
      <p>Toni Michelle Braxton (born October 7, 1967)[3][4] is an American singer, songwriter, pianist, record producer,
        actress, television personality, and philanthropist. She began performing with her sisters in a family group
        known as The Braxtons in the late 1980s, who were signed to Arista Records.

        Braxton attracted the attention of producers Antonio "L.A." Reid and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, later recording
        a series of songs for them before being signed to their Arista-distributed imprint, LaFace Records. Her
        self-titled debut studio album (1993) reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States,
        selling 10 million copies worldwide and seeing the international success of the singles "Another Sad Love Song"
        and "Breathe Again". The album brought Braxton three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist.</p>

      <p>Secrets (1996), Braxton's second studio album, saw continued commercial success, selling 15 million copies and
        generating the singles "You're Makin' Me High" and "Un-Break My Heart", which became her first singles to reach
        the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. Secrets brought Braxton an additional two Grammy
        Awards, for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album.

        Her third studio album, The Heat (2000), opened at number 2 on the Billboard 200 and saw the success of its lead
        single, "He Wasn't Man Enough", which reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and brought Braxton her sixth
        Grammy Award, for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.

        Braxton's subsequent studio albums, More Than a Woman (2002), Libra (2005) and Pulse (2010), were released amid
        contractual disputes and health issues, including a lawsuit against her former manager for mismanaging her
        relationship with Arista Records. In 2014, Braxton and longtime collaborator Babyface released a duet album
        entitled Love, Marriage & Divorce, which earned the duo an additional Grammy Award for Best R&B Album in 2015.
      </p>

      <p>In 2018, Braxton released her eighth studio album Sex & Cigarettes. The album earned Braxton three Grammy Award
        nominations: Best R&B Album, and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for the single "Long as I Live".

        Throughout her career, Braxton has sold over 67 million records, including 41 million albums worldwide. She has
        won seven Grammy Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, seven American Music Awards, among numerous other
        accolades.

        Aside from her success in music, Braxton has become a television executive producer and personality, being
        involved in the seventh season of the reality competition series Dancing with the Stars and in a reality series
        entitled Braxton Family Values, where Braxton is executive producer and star since 2011 on We TV. Braxton is
        also an executive producer of its spin-off, starring her younger sister, Tamar, Tamar & Vince. In 2011, Braxton
        was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.</p>
